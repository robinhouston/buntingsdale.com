Where to go

Christ Church Little Drayton is near Market Drayton on Buntingsdale Road, on the left-hand side as you come from Market Drayton. Buntingsdale Hall is a mile further down the road.


Getting there

If coming by car, it should be possible to park along the road by the church. We’re hoping we’ll be able to use the field opposite for additional parking too.

Public transport is more complicated. If you can get a lift with someone who is coming by car, that may be a better option.

There are buses from Stoke-on-Trent and Shrewsbury, but neither of them run on Sunday. 

The closest railway station is Prees, about ten miles away, which will be connected by rail-replacement bus to Crewe and Shrewsbury.


Where to stay

At the time of writing, rooms are available at these hotels in Market Drayton:

 - The Tudor House Hotel: http://www.thetudorhousehotel.com/

 - The Four Alls Inn: http://www.thefouralls.com/

There is a Premier Inn in Newport, about 13 miles away, and another three a few miles further down the road in Telford.

Hardy guests are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep on the floor at Buntingsdale Hall. There will be a fire, but it may be cold once the fire goes out.


Children

There is a playground opposite the church, which restless children may appreciate.

At Buntingsdale Hall we’re hoping to provide sausages for children, but you may prefer to bring food for your children to eat.
